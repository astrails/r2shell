- support equivalent of shell -x and -e
  -e should throw exception when command returns non-zero value
- support status query (if test("-x", "/bin/bash"))
  probably need another kind of rewrite (process3?) and fire it on if conditions and probably on some logic operations.
- define && and || to use status
+ rewrite 'for' and 'iter'
- need other rewrites?
- consider running commands with popen4. on enumeration ca do gets and on exec - read and dump to screen (w/o buffering.)
